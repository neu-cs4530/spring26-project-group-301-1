 * this:
 *
 *     {

 *         [null, null, null],

 * like this:
 *
 *    [ [ 'X', 'O', null ],
 *      [ 'X', null, 'O' ],
 *      [ 'X', null, null ] ]
 *
 * then winningEntry should be `[[0,0], [1,0], [2,0]]`. (Or some other permutation,
 * like `[[2,0], [1,0], [0, 0]]`.)
 *
 * If no one has triumphed yet, for example if the board looks like this:
 *
 *    [ [ 'X', 'O', null ],
 *      [ null, null, 'O' ],
 *      [ 'X', null, null ] ]
 *
 * then winningEntry should be `null`.
 *
 * If there are multiple winning positions, any winning position can
 * be returned.

/**
 * A move in tic-tac-toe is a two-element list of numbers between 0 and 2

 *
 *     XX.
 *     OO.
 *     XOX
